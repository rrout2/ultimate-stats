# Project Proposal
## Idea 1: Ultimate Frisbee 2D Game
This will be a birds eye view 2D game of [Ultimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)). 
Controls will be similar to madden format, where different keys link to different players on the field to pass to, and combinations of keys would allow for different angles of throws and such. 
I am going to need to use a C++ 2D game library such as [Chipmunk](https://chipmunk-physics.net/).
This game would also require a decent amount of AI, to control the defense, and offensive players without the disc. 

## Idea 2: Ultimate Frisbee Stats/Coach Tool
Also considering making a statistics/coaching app for Ultimate. This would allow the coach to make rosters, call lines, and keep track of completions, throwaway, goals, assists, and drops. An additional feature not typical of most stats app would allow coaches to keep track of yards gained or lost per throw. I would need to use a GUI framework like [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download).
