## 4/24/18

* Added extensive offensive UI grid in order to keep track of yards gained
* Green areas to delineate endzones
* added throwing_yards and receiving_yards stat for player class
* buttons not yet functional, so no stats tracked yet

* Added basic defense GUI w/o functionality.

## 4/25/18
* need to figure out way to seamlessly go between offense and defense UIs
* Program keeps crashing on offense click from chooseside ðŸ˜¢
* when offense does work, throwaway and drop buttons work usually, but not yet keeping track of offensive stats. 
* defense has semi-functional 'D' and 'Opp. throwaway' buttons, hopefully keeping track of D stat
* removed green endzones temporarily because they blocked buttons for some reason
* added additional backend offensive trackers to keep track of who has disc, and how far upfield each throw/catch goes
* long way to go
