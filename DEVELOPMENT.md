* Added basic defense GUI w/o functionality.

## 4/25/18 - 5 hrs
* need to figure out way to seamlessly go between offense and defense UIs
* Program keeps crashing on offense click from chooseside ðŸ˜¢
* when offense does work, throwaway and drop buttons work usually, but not yet keeping track of offensive stats. 
* defense has semi-functional 'D' and 'Opp. throwaway' buttons, hopefully keeping track of D stat
* removed green endzones temporarily because they blocked buttons for some reason
* added additional backend offensive trackers to keep track of who has disc, and how far upfield each throw/catch goes
* long way to go

## 4/26/18 - 2 hrs
* went through with debugger to determine some points of crash
  * fixed pick up crash

## 4/27/18 - 2 hrs
* Continued looking for why it crashes when it goes offense -> chooseside -> offense
* unable to figure out crash 

## 4/29/18 - 2 hrs
* continued looking for crash reason to no avail

## 4/30/18 - 6 hrs
* decided to move on, worked on backend stats keeping as well as score tracking
* now can track throwing yards and receiving yards based on the 'catch' button 
* worked on score display in chooseside ui
* still can't figure out pointers for score
* score always rockets to thousands
* score now update works for defense, not offense
